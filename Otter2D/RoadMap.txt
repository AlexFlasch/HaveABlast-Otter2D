Roadmap for beyond version 1.0:

* Develop the UI stuff into something usable.

Right now there's the beginnings of OtterUI, which is used for menu systems driven by controllers.  At some point I'll
add support or mouse and keyboard type stuff as well.

* Hide all of the dll files somehow.

There are a lot of dll files in the root folder and this can look really messy.  I want to try to get all the dlls embedded somehow.

* SpriteBatch

There is some groundwork laid out now to use SpriteBatch, but there are a handful of bugs to squish before it's deemed totally useable.

* Mac and Linix Support

Better Mac and Linux support.  I know it's possible, but I am very inexperienced with Mac and Linux systems.

* Auto Tiling

I want to get some form of auto tiling in for those game jam scenarios.
