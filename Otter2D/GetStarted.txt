1. New Console Application

2. Add Project to Solution:
	Otter.csproj

3. Add References:
	Project:
	Otter

4. Add lines to Program.cs:
	Game game = new Game("Game", 1920, 1080); //creates a game with internal resolution 1920 x 1080
    	game.SetWindow(1600, 900); //outputs the game to a window scaled down to 1600 x 900

    	game.Start(); //starts the game loop

5. Add "using Otter" at the top of Program.cs

6. Push F5 and hopefully a window pops open.

Basic Otter Game Project Set Up (MonoDevelop)

1. Start a new solution for your game (Console Application)

2. Right click on your solution -> Add -> Add Existing Project -> select the .csproj from Otter.

3. You may have to set your project to use .net 4.0 by right-clicking -> Options -> General

4. A dialog may pop up asking you to change the project file format. Select the 2010 version from Microsoft.

5. Right-click on your project's References -> Edit References -> Projects and tick "Otter".

(Thanks to Timo Paulssen for the MonoDevelop guide!)

========================

"It's not working"
	- Make sure you added the project to visual studio with the method above!
	- If you're getting a missing dll error, it's probably not copying the dll files to the bin folder.
	- Mark all the dll files in Otter to "Copy if Newer" in Visual Studio

========================

Advanced Set Up:

For direct access to SFML features, add references to the files inside Otter/Lib.	

========================

More Info:
	- game.Start(); will begin the game loop, so no more code after this will be executed.
	- Set game.FirstScene to your first scene before you use Start();
	- You can also add an Action to game.OnInit to do things before the game starts running.
	- Make sure the dll files in the otter root folder are set to "Copy if newer."
